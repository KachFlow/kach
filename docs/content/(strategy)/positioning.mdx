title: "Positioning"
description: "Where Kach sits versus correspondent banking, DeFi lending, and bridge networks."
---

Kach positions itself between:

- **Traditional correspondent banking**: Slow and capital intensive, but regulated and trusted.
- **Crypto-native lending protocols**: Efficient and composable, but often detached from real-world use cases and limited by on-chain collateral requirements.
- **Cross-chain liquidity and bridge solutions**: Connect token liquidity across ecosystems, but do not solve the working capital problem for regulated entities handling fiat.

Kach aims to:

- **Leverage** the existing stablecoin and DeFi ecosystem (especially on Aptos) rather than compete with it.
- **Provide** a regulated, auditable path for institutional capital to earn yield from real-world cross-border flows.
- **Complement**, not replace, existing payment infrastructure by making liquidity cheaper and more flexible.

## Differentiators

- **Credit surface**: Only Attestators hold on-chain credit rights, so Clients and depositors remain outside Kach’s risk perimeter.
- **Liquidity velocity**: Short-tenor credit cycles recycle capital multiple times per month, turning trapped balances into yield.
- **Transparent tooling**: [Position NFTs](/glossary#position-nft), PRTs, and audit-friendly event logs give regulators and partners real-time visibility into [utilization](/glossary#utilization) and losses.
- **Jurisdictional coverage**: [Bayta](/glossary#bayta) pairs global underwriting standards with localized partners to respect corridor-specific rules while keeping Kach permissionless for depositors.

## Competitive lens

| Model | Advantages | Missing pieces |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Correspondent banking | Deep compliance expertise, existing bank relationships. | Prefunded nostro/vostro accounts lock up capital and slow payouts. |
| DeFi lending | On-chain transparency, composability, global liquidity. | Lacks [KYB](/glossary#kyb)/KYC, relies on crypto collateral, rarely touches fiat settlement. |
| Bridge-liquidity networks | Move assets cross-chain efficiently. | Do not solve timing gaps between fiat collections and payouts. |
| **Kach** | Short-tenor credit tied to real payout data, Attestator-centric risk, full transparency. | Still early in deployment and relies on curated Attestators. |

The thesis is straightforward: **liquidity velocity becomes yield velocity**. In a world where cross-border demand is growing and stablecoins are increasingly regulated and institutionalized, a purpose-built short-term credit layer can convert trapped capital into a continuously compounding asset class.
