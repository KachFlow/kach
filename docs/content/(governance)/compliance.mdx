Kach never touches retail fiat flows. Liquidity moves in stablecoins on Aptos, and only licensed institutions can access it. Everything else (client onboarding, [AML](/glossary#aml), sanctions checks, and fiat custody) stays with the Attestators who already hold the relevant licenses.

## Perimeter

- **Attestators**: Money transmitters, [EMIs](/glossary#emi), [PSPs](/glossary#psp), VASPs, or similarly regulated entities operating within their jurisdictions. They ingest client fiat, perform [AML](/glossary#aml)/KYC, and manage local payouts.
- **Kach**: Supplies short-term stablecoin credit to those entities under enforceable agreements. The protocol does not take consumer deposits, originate retail loans, or move fiat itself.
- **Depositors**: Face protocol risk, Attestator performance, and the underlying stablecoin/chain risk. They do not become lenders of record to end clients.

## Onboarding & proof

Every Attestator must:

1. Pass [KYB](/glossary#kyb) and licensing checks through third-party providers (e.g., Sumsub, Plaid, local registries).
2. Share [AML](/glossary#aml), transaction-monitoring, and sanctions policies.
3. Prove operating history with financial statements and bank data.

Only once those packages are approved does an Attestator address get whitelisted on-chain.

## Jurisdictional focus

Kach prioritizes operators that:

- Serve Africa, [LATAM](/glossary#latam), and [APAC](/glossary#apac) corridors where FX friction is highest.
- Maintain entities in enforceable jurisdictions (US, EU, or equivalent) so credit agreements can be upheld in court.

Regions that prohibit stablecoins or cross-border lending, or where enforcement is impractical, stay off-limits.

## Non-goals

Kach does not:

- Offer retail credit or consumer loans.
- Provide leverage for speculative trading.
- Issue synthetic assets or algorithmic stablecoins.
- Replace Attestators' [AML](/glossary#aml)/[CFT](/glossary#cft) responsibilities; they remain on the hook for compliance in every corridor they serve.
