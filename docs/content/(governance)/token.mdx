## Tokenless launch

At launch, Kach operates **without** a live token:

-   All fees and interest flows are handled in stablecoins.

-   Governance is controlled by [Bayta Co.](/glossary#bayta) and designated committees.

## Points and future KACH distribution

A **points system** tracks participation, including:

-   Depositor behavior:

    -   Amount and duration of liquidity supplied.

    -   [Tranche](/glossary#tranche) and lock-up choice.

-   Attestator behavior:

    -   Volume processed through Kach.

    -   On-time repayment and Trust Score evolution.

-   Ecosystem contributions:

    -   Integrations,

    -   Referrals,

    -   Tooling and risk model improvements.

These points are intended to be used in the future for:

- **KACH token airdrops** or distributions.
- Governance rights.
- Revenue-sharing or protocol fee rebates.

## Incentive design

Beyond base yield:

-   **Depositors** can:

    -   Earn points for longer commitments, riskier [tranches](/glossary#tranche), and periods of high [utilization](/glossary#utilization).

    -   Gain priority in future KACH allocations.

-   **Attestators** can:

    -   Improve Trust Scores with consistent on-time repayment.

    -   Qualify for lower rates, higher limits, and reputational benefits (leaderboard rankings).

    -   Earn points for routing more volume through Kach.

-   **Leaderboards**:

    -   Public, on-chain leaderboards for top-performing Attestators and depositors improve transparency and create soft reputational pressure.

    -   This also supports community oversight and aligns behavior with long-term protocol health.

## Protocol revenue and reserves

The protocol earns in stablecoins; there is no live token at launch.

- **Interest skim**: 5–10% of gross Attestator interest routes to the protocol reserve before tranche distribution. This funds operations, insurance buffers, and future audits.
- **Penalty fees**: Late repayments or Trust Score downgrades trigger penalty interest that also flows to reserves.
- **Attestator onboarding fees**: One-time or periodic fees (denominated in stablecoins) can apply to new limits to cover underwriting costs.
- **Bridge/intake fees (optional)**: Cross-chain deposits may carry a small fee to cover routing and risk controls; waived when demand requires acceleration.
- **NFT lifecycle fees (keep minimal)**: Split/merge actions for Position NFTs stay free or near zero; the only goal is to prevent spam, not to monetize.

Allocation policy (governance-controlled):

- First fund the protocol reserve to a target buffer (e.g., months of opex + tail-risk cushion).
- Then cover core ops (attestation verifier, monitoring, incident response).
- Surplus, if any, can later be directed by governance to buybacks, grants, or fee reductions once a token exists.

## Governance runway

- **Phase 0: Bootstrap (now)** – [Bayta Co.](/glossary#bayta) operates multisig-controlled parameters (pool caps, Attestator onboarding, pause). Weekly ops notes and parameter changes are published with rationale.
- **Phase 1: Guarded governance (post-audit, mainnet alpha)** – Expand the multisig to include an Aptos Foundation observer and an independent risk advisor. Add timelocks for non-emergency changes and public change logs for rates, utilization targets, and reserve skims.
- **Phase 2: Token-enabled committees (post-utilization milestones)** – Introduce KACH governance where token holders elect committee members for risk, parameters, and treasury. Votes ratify limit proposals, bridge allowlists, and tranche mixes. Community veto over non-emergency changes with short timelocks.
- **Phase 3: Broader token governance (after proven loss performance)** – Delegate budgets for grants/tooling, rotate committee seats on cadence (e.g., quarterly), and constrain admin keys to emergency-only functions with mandatory reporting and post-mortems.

Decision transparency stays mandatory in every phase: published minutes, signer lists, quorum rules, and a registry of active parameter sets so LPs and Attestators can verify the governance surface area.
