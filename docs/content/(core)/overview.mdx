## Concept

Kach is a stablecoin-native liquidity and settlement network built for timing gaps in regulated cross-border payments. The protocol pairs permissionless deposits with fully underwritten usage: anyone can supply capital, but only licensed settlement providers known as **Attestators** can borrow.

At a glance:
- **Depositors** move USDC (and later other approved assets) into dedicated pools on Aptos to earn yield from short, recurring credit cycles.
- **Clients** originate fiat payment instructions entirely off-chain, fund their chosen Attestator, and never interact with Kach directly.
- **Attestators** are vetted fintechs, remittance providers, [PSPs](/glossary#psp), and FX brokers who ingest client fiat, draw credit in stablecoins, run each payout, and repay within days.
- **[Bayta Co.](/glossary#bayta)** operates underwriting, risk, and governance bootstrapping until the system meets decentralization milestones.

Rather than parking cash in dozens of nostro accounts, Attestators draw just-in-time liquidity for 1–5 day cycles, repay once fiat lands, and immediately recycle their limit. Clients stay off-chain and regulated relationships stay intact, but the core accounting is visible to anyone.

## Design principles

- **Open liquidity, permissioned usage**: Deposits are public; borrowing requires licensing, [KYB](/glossary#kyb), and approval.
- **Short-tenor, high-velocity credit**: Standard cycles last a few days, with longer tenors granted only to top-performing Attestators.
- **On-chain transparency, off-chain diligence**: Credit files, [KYB](/glossary#kyb), and attestations live within controlled systems, while draws, repayments, and [utilization](/glossary#utilization) stay on-chain for easy auditing.
- **Chain-native settlement**: All pool logic, NAV tracking, and receivable accounting live on Aptos, which already processes multi-billion-dollar stablecoin flows with low fees and sub-second finality.<a href="/references#ref-3">[3]</a><a href="/references#ref-4">[4]</a><a href="/references#ref-5">[5]</a>
- **Progressive decentralization**: Governance starts with [Bayta](/glossary#bayta)-held committees and migrates to token-driven processes once operating thresholds are hit.

## Protocol mechanics

### Liquidity pools

1. Each supported stablecoin runs through its own pool configuration (for example Kach Pool (USDC)). Governance sets [tranche](/glossary#tranche) mixes, lock-ups, and [utilization](/glossary#utilization) targets per pool.
2. Deposits mint an NFT **Position Object** instead of fungible [tranche](/glossary#tranche) tokens. Every NFT stores the stablecoin, [tranche](/glossary#tranche), share count, lock-up, unlock timestamp, creation timestamp, and NAV index.
3. Pools emit events for every deposit, NFT split/merge, yield accrual, withdrawal, and realized loss so ledgers and analytics pipelines can mirror the chain exactly.
4. A protocol reserve, funded by a share of Attestator interest, adds protection above junior capital and covers operating costs.

[Position NFTs](/glossary#position-nft) are the only representation of depositor claims. Holders can transfer them, split them for partial exits, or merge similar positions, but lock-ups and timestamps always travel with the object. Withdrawals burn the NFT and release principal plus accrued yield to whoever currently controls it, not the original depositor.

Even though the pool [contract](https://github.com/KachFlow/kach) is generic, accounting stays asset-aware. Each NFT references its stablecoin, NAV curves run independently per asset, and loss waterfalls respect that metadata.

### Credit underwriting and limits

1. Attestators complete [KYB](/glossary#kyb), licensing checks, and cash-flow reviews before receiving a Trust Score and proposed limit.
2. The underwriting committee sets tenor, maximum outstanding balance, and concentration caps, then posts those parameters on-chain through multisig so every draw references an auditable file.
3. Each Attestator signs enforceable agreements that cover repayment obligations, data access, and attestation requirements instead of pre-funding balances.
4. Trust Scores move with every draw and repayment. On-time performance nudges scores upward and unlocks higher tiers; late events drag scores down and can freeze credit immediately.

Even though Attestators are regulated institutions, Kach continues to use the term “underwriting” because [Bayta](/glossary#bayta) evaluates how much short-term exposure each entity should consume, sets tenors, defines diversification limits, and enforces remediation when risk signals degrade.

Draw permissions, limit records, and [KYB](/glossary#kyb) attestations stay inside controlled systems, so no transferable token represents credit rights. A client cannot inherit an Attestator's access, and a third party cannot purchase a limit without going through onboarding again.

### Payment Receivable Tokens (PRTs)

1. Every draw mints a non-transferable PRT held by the pool [contract](https://github.com/KachFlow/kach).
2. Each PRT records principal, rate, tenor, creation and maturity timestamps, the Attestator ID, a Trust Score snapshot, the attestation payload hash, and status (open, repaid, defaulted).
3. NAV calculations, [utilization](/glossary#utilization) metrics, and [tranche](/glossary#tranche)-level yield accrual reference outstanding PRTs. When a repayment lands, the matching PRT burns and its realized yield is pushed to [tranches](/glossary#tranche), reserves, and penalties where applicable.

### Settlement and reconciliation

1. Attestators tag each draw with contextual metadata (for example supplier IDs) and upload banking attestations via secure APIs; hashed proofs land on Aptos without exposing client data.
2. Once repayments arrive, [smart contracts](https://github.com/KachFlow/kach) calculate interest, allocate it across [tranches](/glossary#tranche) and reserves, and reopen headroom immediately so capital can be redeployed the same day.
3. If a payment defaults, Kach enforces the Attestator's legal agreements and then waterfalls any remaining loss through junior, mezzanine, and senior [tranches](/glossary#tranche) exactly as described in Tranches and Risk Layers.

## Why Attestators matter

Fiat settlement will always require trusted operators because cash still hops across bank ledgers, FX desks, and jurisdiction-specific [PSPs](/glossary#psp). Kach keeps that trust surface narrow:

- **Cryptographic accountability**: Each draw requires a signed payload from the Attestator. The PRT stores the payload hash so tampering is obvious.
- **Single credit surface**: Clients are invisible to the protocol. The only question is whether an Attestator honored its draw, backed by Trust Scores and legal agreements.
- **Deterministic accounting**: Limits, [utilization](/glossary#utilization), rate schedules, and waterfalls live in Move. Attestators handle fiat realities; the math remains deterministic and auditable on-chain.
