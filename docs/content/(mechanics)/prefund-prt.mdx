## Overview

The **Prefund PRT** system is an advanced credit mechanism that allows highly trusted borrowers (Attestators) to draw credit **without upfront attestation**, enabling faster access to liquidity for time-sensitive payment flows. This is a significant departure from the standard PRT flow and requires exceptional trust scores.

## Standard vs. Prefund Flow

### Standard PRT Flow
1. Attestator verifies off-chain receivable
2. Creates on-chain Attestation object
3. Draws credit using the attestation
4. Single repayment required
5. PRT burned on full repayment

**Requirement**: Trust Score ≥ 60

### Prefund PRT Flow
1. Attestator draws credit **immediately** (no upfront attestation)
2. Executes real-world payment
3. Makes **partial repayments** as receivables are collected
4. Provides attestation **with each repayment**
5. PRT burned when fully repaid

**Requirement**: Trust Score ≥ 95

## Trust Score Threshold

The prefund system requires a trust score of **95 or higher** (out of 100). This threshold ensures only borrowers with:
- Proven track record of on-time payments
- Substantial payment history
- Minimal late or defaulted loans
- Strong reputation with the protocol

Achieving a 95 trust score typically requires:
- Multiple successful repayment cycles
- Zero recent defaults
- Minimal late payments
- Consistent performance over time

## Partial Repayments

Unlike standard PRTs that require single full repayment, prefund PRTs support **multiple partial repayments**:

```move
// Example: $10,000 prefund loan
Day 0:   Draw $10,000 USDC (no attestation required)
Day 10:  Repay $5,000 + attestation for first receivable
Day 20:  Repay $3,000 + attestation for second receivable
Day 28:  Repay $2,000 + interest + attestation for final receivable
```

Each repayment must include:
- Amount being repaid (can be partial)
- Attestation proving the corresponding receivable was collected off-chain
- Proof hash linking to real-world settlement

## Time-Weighted Interest

Prefund PRTs use **time-weighted interest calculation** that only charges interest on outstanding principal for the actual days outstanding:

### Formula

```
Interest = Outstanding Principal × Rate × (Days Elapsed / Total Tenor Days)
```

### Example Calculation

**Loan Details**:
- Principal: $10,000 USDC
- Tenor: 30 days
- Rate: 120 bps (1.20%)
- Expected interest at full term: $120 USDC

**Repayment Schedule**:

**Day 0-10** (10 days elapsed):
- Outstanding: $10,000
- Interest accrued: $10,000 × 0.012 × (10/30) = **$40**

**Day 10 Repayment**: Pay $5,000 principal + $40 interest

**Day 10-20** (10 more days):
- Outstanding: $5,000 (remaining)
- Interest accrued: $5,000 × 0.012 × (10/30) = **$20**

**Day 20 Repayment**: Pay $3,000 principal + $20 interest

**Day 20-28** (8 more days):
- Outstanding: $2,000 (remaining)
- Interest accrued: $2,000 × 0.012 × (8/30) = **$6.40**

**Day 28 Final Repayment**: Pay $2,000 principal + $6.40 interest

**Total Interest Paid**: $40 + $20 + $6.40 = **$66.40**

This is **$53.60 less** than if the full $10,000 had been outstanding for 30 days, rewarding the borrower for early partial repayments.

## Early Repayment Effect

There is no explicit bonus for early repayment. Borrowers still benefit economically because time-weighted interest only accrues on outstanding principal, so partial or early repayments lower total interest and reopen headroom faster.

## Benefits of Prefund System

### For Borrowers (Attestators)
- **Faster liquidity access**: No waiting for attestation creation
- **Flexible repayment**: Match repayments to actual receivable collection
- **Lower interest**: Pay only for funds actually used and time outstanding
- **Operational efficiency**: Better cash flow management

### For the Protocol
- **Risk mitigation**: Only available to proven performers (TS ≥ 95)
- **Capital efficiency**: Faster repayment = higher velocity = more yield
- **Stronger relationships**: Rewards top-tier Attestators with better terms
- **Alignment**: Incentivizes behavior that benefits both parties

### For Liquidity Providers
- **Higher returns**: Increased capital velocity from faster repayments
- **Lower risk**: Prefund access only granted to most reliable borrowers
- **Better utilization**: Reduced idle time between cycles

## Technical Implementation

The prefund system is implemented in the `prt.move` and `credit_engine.move` modules:

### Key Functions

**Drawing Prefund Credit** (`credit_engine.move`):
```move
public entry fun draw_credit_prefund<FA>(
    borrower: &signer,
    pool_addr: address,
    amount: u64,
    tenor_seconds: u64,
    metadata_uri: String
)
```

Requirements checked:
- Trust score ≥ 95
- Credit line has sufficient headroom
- Pool has sufficient liquidity
- Pool not paused

**Partial Repayment** (`prt.move`):
```move
public fun partial_repay_prt<FA>(
    pool_signer: &signer,
    prt: Object<PRT<FA>>,
    repayment_amount: u64
): (u64, u64, u64)
```

Returns: `(repayment_amount, interest_paid, new_outstanding)`

Requirements:
- Amount ≤ outstanding principal
- Called internally by credit_engine for attested repayments
- Calculates time-weighted interest
- Updates PRT status
- Marks PRT as REPAID when fully paid

## Risk Controls

Despite the flexibility, the prefund system maintains strict risk controls:

1. **High Trust Score Requirement**: Only borrowers with TS ≥ 95 can access
2. **Attestation Per Repayment**: Each partial payment requires proof of receivable collection
3. **Credit Line Limits**: Still subject to overall credit line max outstanding
4. **Status Tracking**: PRT status (OPEN, REPAID, LATE, DEFAULTED) continuously monitored
5. **Trust Score Impact**: Late or defaulted prefund loans have severe scoring penalties

## Attestation Requirements

While prefund draws don't require upfront attestation, **each repayment must include attestation**:

- Proof hash must reference real-world settlement
- Attestator must verify the corresponding receivable was collected
- Amount attested must match or exceed repayment amount
- Missing attestations block further draws

This ensures that while speed is prioritized, accountability is maintained throughout the loan lifecycle.

## When to Use Prefund

**Ideal Use Cases**:
- Time-sensitive cross-border payments with tight settlement windows
- High-frequency corridors with proven performance
- Situations where receivables are collected in stages
- Attestators with strong operational track record

**Not Recommended For**:
- New Attestators (need to build trust score first)
- Unpredictable or volatile corridors
- Single large receivables (standard PRT more efficient)
- Borrowers with recent late payments

## Monitoring and Compliance

The protocol emits detailed events for prefund operations:

```move
struct PRTMinted {
    prt_address: address,
    attestator: address,
    pool_address: address,
    principal: u64,
    interest_rate_bps: u64,
    tenor_seconds: u64,
    maturity_timestamp: u64,
    timestamp: u64
}

struct PRTPartialRepayment {
    prt_address: address,
    attestator: address,
    repayment_amount: u64,
    interest_paid: u64,
    outstanding_principal: u64,
    repayment_number: u64,
    timestamp: u64
}
```

Off-chain monitoring systems track:
- Prefund utilization rates
- Partial repayment patterns
- Attestation compliance
- Trust score trajectories
- Default rates for prefund vs. standard loans

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements under consideration:
- Dynamic prefund thresholds based on corridor risk
- Graduated prefund limits (higher TS = higher prefund limit)
- Automated attestation aggregation for batch repayments
- Integration with real-time settlement APIs
- Zero-knowledge proofs for private attestations
