## A

### AML
Anti-Money Laundering. Regulatory controls used to detect and prevent illicit finance.

### APAC
Asia-Pacific. Regional grouping that covers Asian and Pacific countries; used throughout to describe settlement corridors.

### Attestator
Regulated settlement provider that receives fiat from clients, requests Kach credit, executes payouts, signs attestations, and repays all exposure on-chain.

## B

### Bayta
Operator of the Kach protocol during early phases; manages underwriting, risk, and governance bootstrapping until community control expands.

## C

### CFT
Countering the Financing of Terrorism. Regulatory controls focused on detecting and preventing terrorism financing.

### Client
Off-chain entity (importer, exporter, marketplace, fintech, treasury, etc.) that originates fiat payout instructions and relies on its Attestator to interface with Kach.

## E

### EMI
Electronic Money Institution; regulated entity authorized to issue e-money and provide payment services in jurisdictions such as the EU or UK.

## K

### KachFlow
Short-term credit engine that issues Payment Receivable Tokens (PRTs) for every Attestator draw, tracks utilization, and enforces Trust Scores.

### KYB
Know Your Business; regulatory process for verifying the identity, ownership, and licensing of corporate counterparties.

## L

### LATAM
Latin America. Regional grouping used to describe settlement corridors across Central and South America.

## M

### MSB
Money Services Business; a US designation for regulated companies that transmit money, issue stored value, or provide currency exchange services.

## N

### NAV (Net Asset Value)
Per-share value of a pool after accounting for accrued yield and realized losses. Expressed as a multiplier (scaled by 1e18) applied to each tranche’s shares. Kach tracks NAV separately per tranche; Position NFTs record the NAV index at deposit so redemptions reflect the performance earned while the NFT was held.

### Nostro account
“Our money with you”; a bank account held by a financial institution in a foreign bank, usually denominated in that bank’s local currency.

## P

### Payment Receivable Token (PRT)
Non-transferable on-chain object that represents an Attestator draw and stores principal, rate, tenor, timestamps, Attestator ID, Trust Score snapshot, and attestation hash until repayment.

### Position NFT
Non-fungible token minted for each depositor position. Encodes the deposited stablecoin, tranche, lock-up, NAV index, and timestamps so yield and redemption rights follow the NFT.

### PSP
Payment Service Provider; licensed platform that processes payments on behalf of clients, often across borders or between payment networks.

## T

### Tranche
Risk slice within a pool (senior, junior) that dictates yield, loss absorption order, and lock-up expectations.

### Trust Score
Dynamic score assigned to each Attestator using a hybrid of amount-weighted and count-based performance with severity multipliers (late vs default), recency decay, per-loan concave weighting, and a confidence factor that grows with history depth; also gates maximum loan size via an anti-gaming rule.

## U

### Utilization
Percentage of pool liquidity currently deployed to Attestator draws; guides rate adjustments, intake gating, and withdrawal planning.

## V

### Vostro account
“Your money with us”; a bank account held by a foreign financial institution inside a domestic bank, denominated in local currency.
